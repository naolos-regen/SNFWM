** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
- These are done once a file changes, not always on build process,
  because it's too heavy and useless.
- For testing env use criterion
- happy coding

** Todos
- I gotta stop thinking that globals are a bad thing.
- I gotta stop wanting to generalize things that i only need for 1 useage.
- fix bugs when killing a window & switching a window
- fix bugs when bar-name changes / or get rid of it entirely (possibly going to use only 1 bar for switching windows on-click / when comboed with keys)
