** Tests

- These are done once a file changes, not always on build process,
  because it's too heavy and useless.
- For testing env use criterion
- happy coding

** Todos
- I gotta stop thinking that globals are a bad thing.
- I gotta stop wanting to generalize things that i only need for 1 useage.
- fix bugs when killing a window & switching a window
- add 1 bar that will indicate how many windows there are in the stack.
- add possibility to change windows according to their numbers in stack.
- add multiple workspaces
